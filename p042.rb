# Coded triangle numbers
# http://projecteuler.net/problem=42
#
# The nth term of the sequence of triangle numbers is given by, tn = Â½n(n+1);
# so the first ten triangle numbers are:
#
#   1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...
#
# By converting each letter in a word to a number corresponding to its alphabetical
# position and adding these values we form a word value. For example, the word
# value for SKY is 19 + 11 + 25 = 55 = t_10. If the word value is a triangle number
# then we shall call the word a triangle word.
#
# Using p042_words.txt, a 16K text file containing nearly two-thousand common
# English words, how many are triangle words?
